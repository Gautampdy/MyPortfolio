            <h1>7) HealthCare Application Using Blockchain </h1>
            <div>
                The healthcare application is a blockchain-based solution designed to transform the
                management of medical records. Built with Solidity, Remix Ethereum IDE, Ganache,
                MetaMask, and React.js, it allows users to securely enter and manage their medical details,
                ensuring that information is stored immutably on the blockchain. This feature provides a
                tamper-proof record of users' health data, which can be easily accessed, particularly in
                emergencies where quick access to medical history is critical. Additionally, the application
                empowers users to control access to their medical information through an authorization feature,
                enabling them to grant permissions to specific addresses, such as trusted healthcare providers.
                This selective sharing enhances privacy while promoting collaboration in healthcare. With a
                comprehensive dashboard to view all medical records associated with a user's address, the
                application leverages blockchain technology to improve security, transparency, and user control
                over personal health information, ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience.

                by strengthening long-term connections within the academic community and encouraging
